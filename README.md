# Peerasait Prachaseree (Jeffrey)

Hi everyone! I am Jeffrey, an current mechanical engineering PhD candidate in the [Lejeune Lab](https://github.com/Lejeune-Lab/) at Boston University. Originally, I am from Thailand. I completed my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from University of California, San Diego. Currently, I work at the intersection between applied mechanics and computational science to model and understand the behaviour of solids under finite deformation for applications in biomechanics and engineered materials.

- ðŸ”­ Current Research Interests: 
  - Computational/Applied mechanics
  - Scientific Computing
  - Nonlinear Solid Mechanics
  - Mechanical Metamaterials
  - Mechanical Computing/Intelligence
